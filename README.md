# 📊 Ml Engineer Journey – IPT Studies

Welcome to my personal roadmap and progress tracker for becoming a **Ml Engineer**.  
This repository documents my daily learning, practice, and projects as part of my **Industrial Practical Training (IPT)** August 2025 and self-study journey.

## 🚀 About This Repo

- 📌 Tracks my **day-by-day progress** in data science
- 🧑‍💻 Includes notes, exercises, and practice code
- 📚 Covers essential topics like:
  - Python programming
  - Data analysis
  - Machine learning
  - Data visualization
  - Statistics & mathematics foundations

## 🗂️ Branch Structure

Each day of my learning has its own branch:

- `Day-1` → [IPT Papers & Day 1 Notes]
- `Day-2` → (to be added…)
- `Day-3` → (to be added…)

The `main` branch contains this README file.

## 🎯 Goals

1. Build strong foundations in **Python** and **statistics**
2. Learn and apply **machine learning algorithms**
3. Work on **real-world projects**
4. Document everything for consistency & accountability
